It aims to provide a smooth and reliable user experience for online shoppers, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases securely.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to:
- **Facilitate E-commerce Transactions**: Provide users with a seamless interface to browse and purchase products online, securely processing payments through PayPal.
- **Learn Modern Frontend Techniques**: Demonstrate the use of key technologies like React, Next.js, and PayPal's integration to handle complex user flows in an e-commerce application.
- **Showcase Efficient State Management**: Utilize global state management with React Context to keep track of user activities like adding items to the cart, managing user sessions, and handling payments.
- **Improve User Experience**: Implement features like notifications using `notistack` and server-side rendering for enhanced performance and usability.

## Overview

This project is an e-commerce web application built with React and Next.js, designed to allow users to make purchases through PayPal. It leverages modern web development practices, including server-side rendering, efficient state management with React Context (`StoreProvider`), and a notification system (`notistack`) to provide users with feedback during their shopping experience.

The app provides essential features such as secure payment processing with PayPal, a global state for managing the shopping cart, and responsive feedback through snackbars.

## Features

- **PayPal Integration**: Allows users to securely pay for their items using PayPal.
- **Global State Management**: Manages shopping cart data, user sessions, and order processing using `StoreProvider` (React Context).
- **Snackbar Notifications**: Provides real-time feedback to users, displaying success or error messages through `notistack`.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and load times by utilizing Next.js's SSR capabilities.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a smooth experience across all device sizes with responsive layouts.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **PayPal SDK**: Integrated PayPal for secure payment processing.
- **Notistack**: For displaying snackbars (toast notifications) to provide feedback to users.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS for styling components.

### Backend:
- **PayPal API**: Used to process payments.

- **CartItem**: Handles the display and management of items in the shopping cart.
- **StoreProvider**: Manages the global state for the application, handling the shopping cart and user interactions.
- **PayPalScriptProvider**: Wraps the application to manage PayPal's SDK scripts for payments.
- **SnackbarProvider**: Provides feedback to the user via notifications (using `notistack`).
- **_app.js**: Initializes the application with necessary global providers and configurations.

## Usage

1. **Browse Products**: Users can browse a list of available products on the home page.
2. **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart and view the cart contents.
3. **Checkout with PayPal**: When ready, users can proceed to checkout, where they can securely make a payment through PayPal.
4. **Notifications**: Users receive visual feedback through snackbars, informing them about the success or failure of certain actions (e.g., adding to cart or completing a purchase).

## PayPal Integration

The project integrates PayPal to handle payment processing. PayPal scripts are loaded via `PayPalScriptProvider` to ensure secure and efficient transactions.

To use PayPal, make sure to:
1. Create an account at [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/).
2. Get your **Client ID** from the PayPal dashboard and add it to your `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`.
3. The PayPal button will automatically be loaded during checkout and will allow users to pay securely.

## Future Enhancements
